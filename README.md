Original copy of this book can be purchased from [SPE Bookstore](https://store.spe.org/Fundamental-Principles-of-Reservoir-Engineering-P27.aspx)

All examples and problems from the book are worked on Python language.

The book contains **14 units** and **1 Appendix**. In this repo, each unit has 3 folders: 

* `data`: compilation of data in CSV tables for examples and problems
* `functions`: compilation of functions from the Equations in the book to execute certain purposed calculations
* `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks of worked examples and practice problems
